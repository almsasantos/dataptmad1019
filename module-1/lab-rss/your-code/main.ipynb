       "    'value': '<p>In a fast-paced digital world, it is tempting to suppose that deploying the latest technology is the lynchpin to competitive advantage. Extremely powerful digital technologies are now accessible to most companies—meaning you must find new ways to distinguish yourself in a crowded field.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One very effective method for unearthing strategies that differentiate your organization from everyone else is to leverage your people as a competitive advantage. “Using people,” in this context, means placing an emphasis on any full-time employee, contractor, partner, supplier, gig worker, etc., who is part of your extended ecosystem of strategy and delivery. These are the groups and individuals who provide the fuel to make your technology engine work. You will find them interspersed inside and outside your organization, and it is your task to harness their collective power to build a coalition of support for your business. If you do this well, you can use ecosystem engagement as a way to build stickiness between your organization and employees. As we progress through this latest digital era, we are starting to see more strength in numbers—particularly from unexpected partnerships that provide different perspectives and allow ideas and innovation to originate from a variety of sources. By embracing cognitive diversity, these partnerships thrive because they’ve learned how to tap into a variety of players in order to design and deliver a compelling solution. Each time you tap into it, your people ecosystem presents a blank canvas of potential innovation, and capitalizing on their insight and adaptability creates new opportunities for unique advantage.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Organizations that struggle to keep or fully engage their people ecosystem may find themselves facing the quandary of having people who once worked with them or for them easily becoming foes. History shows us that <em>not</em> recognizing the latent talent in your untapped, disengaged employees creates a hazard for your organization: a cohort of employees who understand your strategic priorities and what you value and use that knowledge to compete, providing new services aimed at dissatisfied customers looking for new options. Armed with the quick and easy tools that make spinning up a startup or a competitive initiative effortless, former employees can quickly wreak havoc on your best-laid plans—something that it used to take a much larger organization to accomplish. What can you do? Go on the offense, pursuing a strong people-based competitive advantage to build a vibrant ecosystem of employees and partners who feel valued and aligned with your organizational goals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A significant challenge you might face when you are looking to strengthen your people ecosystem is the temptation to continue operating within your traditional mode of working, and within your traditional types of relationships. Your old ways of working required one level of engagement, but to exploit the power of the digital economy, you have to bring new players into the ecosystem and be far more intentional about the way you interact with them to use their capabilities. As you do this, you will quickly find that what it takes to make one group or person happy is not what it takes to make another group or person happy, and you will constantly negotiate outcomes to ensure everyone feels like they are in a win-win scenario. The digital economy moves at a frenetic pace and causes massive changes in personal and societal expectations. Solutions that worked just a few years ago will no longer keep customers and partners happy. That’s why it’s vital that you maintain an environment where people feel they are in a win-win relationship and they see your success as something that&#8217;s good for them. Leaders who assume they have good relationships with freelancers, contractors, or suppliers can quickly find themselves struggling with the same concerns vocalized by disengaged employees, and this type of disconnect can dramatically impact your level of output. You lose a great deal of innovation capacity when you can no longer count on people to give the extra effort that comes because they are autonomously motivated to succeed. To keep everyone happy and excited at the same time, you will need an agile engagement approach. That means the painstaking work you do today to build a high degree of engagement with your people may have to be revisited often to keep them invested in your organization.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you want to develop a strong, competitive advantage built on the expertise of people in your ecosystem, you should focus on five key strategies:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li><strong>Discover what your customers deeply value</strong>. Develop a cross-functional, inside-out team that focuses intensely on this issue. Nothing works better to discover what your customers value than to have a diverse group of people who can relate to and reflect the customer base. For instance, rather than using all of your talent to concentrate on delivering better features to existing customers, use some of your talent to uncover and solve new problems. This will help you move from a product-centric approach to a customer-centric approach.</li><li><strong>Have a value proposition that people can engage with.</strong> Creating a company identity, placing your company in the marketplace, making clear what you hope to accomplish, the future you want to achieve, and communicating all of that to those you work with provides the raw materials for engagement, for helping those employees, partners, contractors, and even gig workers find a place for themselves in your company’s future.</li><li><strong>Recognize that great people are everywhere in your organization, tucked away where you can&#8217;t see them.</strong> Look for talent spread out through every level in your company and start to use that talent in new ways. Some of your best opportunities for ideation will come from crowdsourcing innovation up, down and across your team. For instance, when leading a technical team, use traditional technical skills like understanding objects, understanding layers, or understanding components in a LEGO-like architecture, and use those functional skills as analogs to the soft skills that help team members understand leadership and how the different parts of the organization relate to each other. Help team members recognize that there are layers to the way that the business works, layers to the way that people work, or layers to relationships. Help people with high potential understand how all parts of the business work together and demonstrate how to conceptualize new ways to use old processes. Transform team knowledge from solely a functional or technical capability to a business capability, and work with your staff to be very deliberate about the roles and opportunities they take or the places where they invest their time.</li><li><strong>Build teams with cognitive diversity.</strong> Deliberately look for people and partners who come to the table from different paths in life. Have multi-generational, multi-ethnic, geographically dispersed teams that understand how to work well together by leaving bias at the door. Have multi-disciplinary teams pour through your data with the express assignment of finding new problems to solve. Recognize that just because you invited everyone to the table, that does not mean they all have the courage to speak up. Provide prompts and cues to ensure team members participate, describing their findings, testing their ideas, and sharing insights into their thought processes. This will spur collaboration, spark innovative ideas within others, and remove the stigma associated with failure. To help move this forward, design your meetings to enable every voice in the group. Talk openly about great attempts that failed, share team successes, and give room for even the most silent participants to open up and share their thoughts. People can often believe the smartest person in the room is also the most confident person in the room, and that&#8217;s not always the case. You can frequently have very astute team members with a wealth of knowledge built from their path in life and professional experiences, but they might lack the confidence or interest in speaking up in front of a group. Create a standard knowledge sharing process so team members can exchange discoveries and discuss ideas in open and honest ways.</li><li><strong>Allow employees to move around in order to develop different capabilities.</strong> You&#8217;ll want to discover early in your team members&#8217; careers what they might want to do later in life. This is true for your partners and suppliers just as it is for your employees. Spend some time discovering their capabilities. Some people might transition into great business leaders, others might become great technical leaders, and others might become strong master contributors who really know your customers and your business well. Regardless of the track they choose, you want use their capabilities strategically so they stay engaged and excited about solving your most pressing business problems. Whether it&#8217;s working as a coder, designing a strategy, or understanding the bowels of the enterprise and how to get things to move when they are stuck, allow team members to grow and be useful in ways that create opportunities in a variety of places. Give them a chance to travel, take on choice assignments, work remotely, change jobs and roles, dabble in fringe interests, or work together on pet projects. This means you will have to hand off commodity work to more junior staff so your senior leaders can grow organically in ways that work for them and the organization. If you overlook this, your people can feel stagnant and will look to create opportunities for movement on their own, which means they will likely look for employment elsewhere.</li></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As you focus on these areas, you will naturally see new and different capabilities emerge. Recognize these capabilities in your people not just for what they can do for you now, but for what they can do for you in the future, and then strategically position them so they can help you transform the business. Placing people in flexible roles helps them come up with autonomous innovation because the deeper they get into technology, the content, or their knowledge of the business, the more they uncover opportunities for you to get better, to modernize, to offer new solutions, or to have the next big thing that might transform the industry. Instead of looking at your people solely as tools to fulfill your current work, look at them as opportunities to uncover new jobs, expand your offerings, design new partnerships, discover a new mission, and recognize new customers. By doing that, you will have a talent advantage that cannot be duplicated.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/MGgJFA4urls\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

The specifications are impressive: 5G will provide a <a href=\"https://www.etsi.org/technologies/5g\">peak data rate</a> of up to 20 Gbps (with 100 Mbps of “<a href=\"https://5gobservatory.eu/info-deployments/5g-performance/\">user experienced data rate</a>”) to mobile devices: cell phones, smart cars, and a lot of devices that haven’t been invented yet. It’s difficult to imagine mobile applications that will require that much data, and 5G’s proponents seem willing to promise just about anything. What will 5G mean in practice? If it’s going to make any real difference, we’ll need to think that through.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The most obvious change 5G might bring about isn’t to cell phones but to local networks, whether at home or in the office. Back in the 1980s, Nicholas Negroponte <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=McBUx67rw7wC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;lpg=PA338&amp;dq=negroponte+everything+wired+will+become+wireless,+and+everything+wireless+will+become+wired.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=cJTyDDyWhR&amp;sig=ACfU3U14LnXEcU_lGE6lm5jHFk30-mCQ1w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiRsZOD7-DlAhWsuFkKHZg9CqwQ6AEwBXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=negroponte%20everything%20wired%20will%20become%20wireless%2C%20and%20everything%20wireless%20will%20become%20wired.&amp;f=false\">said</a> everything wired will become wireless, and everything wireless will become wired. What happens to “last mile” connectivity, which seems to be stuck somewhere around 50 Mbps for homes and several times that for business service? It would be great to have an alternative to the local cable monopoly for high-bandwidth connectivity. We were supposed to have fiber to the home by now. I don’t, do you? High-speed networks through 5G may represent the next generation of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord-cutting\">cord cutting</a>. Can 5G replace wired broadband, allowing one wireless service for home and mobile connectivity? I don’t need more bandwidth for video conferences or movies, but I would like to be able to download operating system updates and other large items in seconds rather than minutes. Anyone who has ever built a Docker container has experienced “now we wait for some giant things to download and be uncompressed.” Those waits can be significant, even if you’re on a corporate network. They could disappear.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rural connectivity is a persistent problem; many rural users (and some urban users) are still limited to dial-up speeds. Although the industry <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-realities-of-rural-5g-deployment-in-the-us/\">claims</a> that 5G will provide better connectivity for rural areas, I’m skeptical. Because 5G uses higher frequencies than 4G, and higher frequencies are more subject to path loss, 5G cells have to be smaller than 4G/LTE cells. If carriers won’t build cell towers for current technology, they aren’t likely to build even more towers for 5G. I suspect rural communities will be left in the dark–again.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As far as mobile and embedded devices go, I don’t see why I need a gigabit on my phone, except perhaps to serve as a Wi-Fi hub when traveling. Phones are a painful way to watch movies–more about that later. 5G enthusiasts frequently say it’s an enabling technology for autonomous vehicles (AV), which will need high bandwidth to download maps and images, and perhaps even to communicate with each other: AV heaven is a world in which all vehicles are autonomous and can therefore collaboratively plan traffic. That may well require 5G–though again, I wonder who is going to make the investment in building out rural networks. Autonomous vehicles that only work in urban or suburban areas are less useful. For applications like communication between AVs, latency–how long it takes to get a response–is more likely to be a bigger limitation than raw bandwidth, and is subject to limits imposed by physics. There are impressive <a href=\"http://www.techplayon.com/5g-nr-control-plane-latency-calculations/\">estimates</a> for latency for 5G, but reality has a tendency to be harsh on such predictions. Reliability will be an even bigger problem than latency. Remember your last trip to New York or San Francisco? Cell service in major cities is often poor because signals are reflected from buildings and attenuated (weakened) as they pass through. Those problems get worse as you go higher in frequency, as 5G does. Whether you’re interested in AVs or some other applications, making mobile connections more reliable is more important than making them faster. 5G intends to do so by trading off congestion against signal quality. That’s a plausible tradeoff, but it remains to be seen whether it works.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Pete Warden, who is working on <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/tinyml/9781492052036/\">machine learning for very low power devices</a>, says 5G is only marginally useful for the applications he cares about. When you’re trying to build a device that will run for months on a coin battery, you realize that the radio takes much more power than the CPU. You have to keep the radio off as much as possible, transmitting data in short, brief bursts. So what about industrial IoT (IIoT), and sensors that can be built into a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/tinyml-the-challenges-and-opportunities-of-low-power-ml-applications/\">sticker</a> and slapped on to machinery? That might be a 5G application–but as Warden has said, the real win here is eliminating batteries and power cords, which in turn requires careful use of low-power networking. 5G isn’t ideal for that, and the first indications are that it will require more power than current technologies.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Regardless of power consumption, I’m not convinced we’ll have lots of IoT devices shipping data back to their respective motherships. We’ve seen the reaction to news that Amazon’s Echo and Google Home send recordings of conversations back to the server. And we’re already seeing devices like smart thermostats and light bulbs being used for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/technology/smart-home-devices-domestic-abuse.html\">harassment</a>. As privacy regulation takes hold and techniques like <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html\">federated learning</a> become more widespread, the need–and desire–for shipping our data far and wide will inevitably decrease.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where is 5G useful? Let’s get back to home networking. I’d gladly give up my 50 Mbps wired connection for gigabit wireless. Again, that’s the ultimate cable cutting, and it creates significant new possibilities. I might not want to watch 4K video on my phone (given current screen technology, to say nothing of our eyes’ angular resolution, high-resolution video on a phone is meaningless), but I might want to send video from my phone to my television using Chromecast.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I’m satisfied with my current Wi-Fi deployment, but I wonder whether I’d even need Wi-Fi in a 5G world. Perhaps, for security and privacy reasons, it makes sense to separate a local network from the rest of the world. But that’s also a problem that 5G vendors could solve; virtual LANs (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN\">VLANs</a>) are hardly a new concept. Gigabit connectivity to laptops, with the cell network providing a VLAN, could also replace office networks. In either case, some hard guarantees about privacy and security would be needed. Given <a href=\"https://www.privacypolicies.com/blog/isp-tracking-you/\">service providers’ records on user tracking</a>, that may be too much to ask.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If we can get some enforceable guarantees about privacy and security on ISP-provided VLANs, I can imagine bigger changes. I’ve long thought it makes little sense to maintain disk drives (whether rust-based or solid-state) that periodically fail and need to be backed up. I do regular backups, but I know I’m the exception. What would the world look like if all of our storage was in the cloud, and access to that storage was so fast we didn’t care? What if all of your documents were in Google Docs, all of your music was in your favorite streaming service? That vision isn’t entirely new; Sun Microsystems had the idea back in the 1990s, and that’s essentially the vision behind Google’s Chromebooks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>How would our usage patterns change with 5G? I have 30 or 40 GB of photos. I could upload them all to Google Photos or some other service, but at 50 Mbps down and 10 Mbps up, that’s not something you want to think about. At a gigabit, you don’t have to think twice. I’ve always been unimpressed by streaming services for music and video, at least partly because they’re least available when you most want them: when you’re flying or on a train, in at a technical conference with 3,000 attendees maxing out the hotel’s network. (Someone once told me “so download everything you’re likely to want to listen to before leaving.”&nbsp; Really.)&nbsp; But with gigabit microcells, this suddenly makes sense. Maybe not on flights, which are out of range of cell towers and where WoeFi will remain the order of the day, and maybe not when you’re driving through rural areas, but if I can get a gigabit network to my phone, why should I care about Amtrak’s slow Wi-Fi or network congestion in my hotel? If an office can get that kind of bandwidth to my laptop, with adequate guarantees for cloud security, why should we worry about office LANs?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whether that excites you or not, that strikes me as a significantly new pattern: we won’t care where our data is. We won’t need to worry about backups. We won’t need to worry (as much) about outages. We can bring our networks with us. We won’t even need to worry as much about security; Google, Amazon, and Microsoft all do better backups than I ever will, are much better at surviving network disruption, and know an awful lot more about how to protect my data. If Google can push their users to <a href=\"https://authy.com/what-is-2fa/\">two-factor authentication</a> (2FA) or the use of a <a href=\"https://www.extremetech.com/computing/274067-google-eliminated-phishing-by-giving-all-85000-employees-usb-security-keys\">security dongle</a>, that’s a huge step toward safe computing. Those cloud providers will, of course, have to guarantee this data remains private–as private as it is when it lives on a personal disk drive or an office fileserver. That’s a problem that’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93Apple_encryption_dispute\">eminently solvable</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The implications for business are even more important. Home users think in gigabytes; businesses are increasingly involved with tera- or petabytes. It’s a lot easier to move large datasets when you have ubiquitous gigabit networks. Whether that’s training data for AI applications or just lots of transaction records, businesses move data, and lots of it. With our current technology, the best way to move a huge amount of data is, all too often, to put <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/snowmobile/\">disk drives on a truck</a>. 5G brings us a lot closer to solving that problem–if we can get hard guarantees about security and privacy. Businesses are even less likely than users to appreciate some third party using their data for their own purposes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I’m sure that 5G will also lead to a new generation of smart devices that can use the bandwidth–devices we haven’t imagined yet. But I’m more interested in something I can imagine, decoupling myself from my data: having access to it any time, any where, without carrying it around, or stashing it on some kind of machine in the closet. That’s the real promise of 5G. <em>— Mike Loukides</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Radar data points: Recent research and analysis</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We recently conducted a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/oreilly-serverless-survey-2019-concerns-what-works-and-what-to-expect/\">survey on serverless architecture adoption</a>. We were pleasantly surprised at the high level of response: more than 1,500 respondents from a wide range of locations, companies, and industries participated. The high response rate tells us that serverless is garnering significant mindshare in the community.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Key findings from the serverless survey include:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>40% of respondents work at organizations that have adopted serverless architecture in some form or another. Reduced operational costs and automatic scaling are the top serverless benefits cited by this group.</li><li>Of the 60% of respondents whose companies haven’t adopted serverless, the leading concerns about the paradigm are security and fear of the unknown.</li><li>About 50% of respondents who adopted serverless three-plus years ago consider their implementations successful or extremely successful, a contrast to the 35% of those adopting serverless a year or less ago experiencing a successful or extremely successful implementation—a gap that suggests serverless experience pays off.</li><li>Respondents who have implemented serverless made custom tooling the top tool choice—implying that vendors’ tools may not fully address what organizations need to deploy and manage a serverless infrastructure.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Read “<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/oreilly-serverless-survey-2019-concerns-what-works-and-what-to-expect/\">O’Reilly serverless survey 2019: Concerns, what works, and what to expect</a>” for full results.

Noting the importance of traceability, he offers an example: &#8220;If I deploy a model that&#8217;s making credit card authorizations, and I keep rejecting someone&#8217;s card, and they come on and say, &#8216;I&#8217;m a member of a minority group, and you keep turning down my charges. Are you prejudiced against me?&#8217; or something like this, I need to know exactly what model was used and how it was trained. There are all kinds of logistical issues that have to be addressed in a real-world production environment.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=75\">01:15</a>)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In some cases, AI and machine learning technologies are being used to improve existing processes, rather than solving new problems. Wampler used car loan approvals as an example: &#8220;It used to take a day or so to get an auto loan, and that worked. You could just come back to the dealer the next day and dream about your beautiful car that night but not actually have it. Companies like Capital One have gotten that [loan approval process] down to seconds. You can get on the app and get an approval for a loan immediately. So, it&#8217;s not something that <em>had</em> to be done in a real-time context, but it changed the world, changed their business being able to do that. There&#8217;s a lot of these sort of pragmatic examples.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=142\">02:22</a>)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Wampler also discussed his personal interest in climate change and how individuals and businesses can use AI and machine learning tools to have a more significant influence than one might think. &#8220;What I&#8217;ve learned is there are a lot of little ways and big ways that add up when we&#8217;re working on stuff like this. One of the promises of tools like artificial intelligence is that it can automate human-level activity in a way that would not be feasible with actual humans doing it. More specifically, organizations like Google are already using sophisticated analytics to reduce the amount of energy they use and more efficiently utilize their machines. Individually, things like that are not going to solve climate change, but they add up. Every ton of carbon that you didn&#8217;t burn is one step in a solution toward the problem of climate change. For all of us, it really comes down to a whole spectrum of little things we can do that add up, from personal things like how we use energy, heat our homes, cook our food, and so forth, to thinking carefully about how we do our jobs and how we can be efficient in operationalizing these things, thinking about how we can help our customers achieve that, and then figuring out ways that we can have more direct influences.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=260\">04:20</a>)</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/UuE-j1TFQLA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

This resulted in systems that left their (inevitable) human operators “with an arbitrary collection of tasks” with respect to which “little thought may have been given to providing support.”</p>\\n<p>This is precisely the kind of problem that robotic process automation (RPA) aims to address.</p>\\n<h2>RPA explained</h2>\\n<p>To understand what RPA is, why it matters, and <a href=\"https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/bdm/2019/11/04/announcing-rpa-enhanced-security-no-code-virtual-agents-and-more-for-microsoft-power-platform/\">why it’s garnered so much interest</a>, you have to understand the case of “Maddie.” Full disclosure: Maddie is a fictional person. She’s a composite of hundreds of thousands (perhaps even millions) of smart, industrious people who are tasked with the IT equivalent of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus\">rolling a large boulder up a hill</a>. One of Maddie’s responsibilities—she has plenty of others—is to manipulate a mouse and click the appropriate buttons (“OK,” “Yes,” “Import”) when prompted to do so by a legacy Windows application. Once an hour, on the hour, Maddie sits in front of an old-school beige computer and clicks a mouse button several hundred times. She’s the vestigial human link in a process—insurance claims processing—that has a mostly automated workflow.</p>\\n<p>Maddie has other responsibilities that challenge her ingenuity, but it’s the drudgery of pointing-and-clicking a mouse that defines her job for her. RPA is a beacon of hope for the Maddies of the world. It enlists software “robots” to automate the rote, repetitive, or tedious tasks that bridge virtual gaps, or facilitate virtual transfers or exchanges, in and between common business processes.</p>\\n<p>Whether it’s copying and pasting text, scraping screens, pointing and clicking (or dragging and dropping) with a mouse, saving changes in one program and importing them into another, etc., software robots are able to interpret inputs, events, and gestures, and trigger responses and communicate with other systems—just as humans do. In fact, robots arguably do these things <em>better</em> than humans do them. Unlike humans, a software robot doesn’t get tired, bored, or distracted, especially when its performing a tedious or repetitive task. Unlike humans, a software robot performs tasks precisely the same way each and every time. Unlike humans, a software robot generates records for each and every task in a workflow. Most important, unlike humans, a robot does not have a capacity for creativity or ingenuity. Robots cannot reflect on and derive innovative solutions to hard problems. They can do only what they’re programmed to do. Core to RPA is the idea that the software robot is the perfect candidate for a range of tasks that neither tax human ingenuity nor engage human passion.</p>\\n<h2>Workflow and back-office automation</h2>\\n<p>Virtual automation has a long history. Prior to RPA, enterprises used several different techniques to automate workflows and back-office processes. Scripting, for example, is the ur-IT automation technology. Virtually anything can be scripted—including keyboard, mouse, and GUI actions. Speaking of mice, another automation technology—screen-scraping—dates from before the widespread use of graphical user interfaces (GUI), mice, and other <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer\">even newer types of human interface devices</a>. Even though mainframe technologies evolved—IBM’s System/360 mainframe gave way to System/370, which was superseded by System/380, and so on—the programs that ran on these systems often did not.</p>\\n<p>In the late 1960s, following the shift from punch cards to magnetic tape, enterprises used optical character recognition (OCR) technologies to digitize their punch-card archives. In the 1980s, they used screen-scraping techniques to capture data from legacy mainframe and minicomputer programs and expose it in different contexts—such as on then-new PCs and Macintoshes. Two decades later, enterprises used screen-scraping to web-enable legacy mainframe, minicomputer, and client-server applications. Speaking of client-server, the succession of paradigm shifts from host-based to client-server to cloud-based architectures helped substantively automate many common workflows and processes. Yes, automation has usually eliminated a small proportion of human jobs; at the same time, however, it has created new opportunities for those well-versed in software, databases, architecture, and operations.</p>\\n<p>But RPA is different. <strong>First</strong>, RPA automates tasks that a human being must perform in a <em>GUI</em>, as distinct to a text-only terminal. These are tasks that comprise gaps in the midst of critical workflows or processes; tasks that (as often as not) connect or span separate programs, systems, or networks.</p>\\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, RPA is smart; it uses machine learning (ML) techniques that learn on the basis of human action in the visual interface. Just by manipulating the mouse and clicking a sequence of “Yes,” “OK,” etc., prompts, a user like Maddie generates a training data set for a software robot to work with and learn from. The Achilles heel of scripts, mouse macros, and other established practices is that they all depend on human prognostication. Imagine a developer writes a script that triggers an action in response to one or more events: say, for example, some combination of function calls and GUI events. For the script to work reliably, however, the developer must anticipate not only expected events (<em>first</em>, the script moves the cursor to the designated X,Y coordinates; <em>second</em> it checks to make sure the designated window is activated; <em>only then</em> does it simulate a mouse click) but <em>exceptions</em>, too—<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case\">edge cases</a>, as when a dialog box captures control of the screen and obscures the “OK” prompt. RPA technology uses ML to discover, understand, and adapt to edge cases that a human user manipulating a mouse could easily deal with—but which would bring a dumb script grinding to a halt.</p>\\n<p><strong>Third</strong>, RPA doesn’t assume that the primary goal of automation is to replace human beings. RPA technologies automate the kinds of tasks that human beings <em>don’t like doing</em>. RPA targets tedious, repetitive, rote, time-consuming tasks. Proponents like to claim that RPA frees human actors (like Maddie) to focus on responsibilities and activities that engage their ingenuity and creativity.</p>\\n<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, RPA expects program, system, and even network heterogeneity. RPA evolved to eliminate gaps in workflows or processes that span disparate GUI-based systems. A history lesson might be helpful here. In the 1990s, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_suite\">packaged software suites</a> emerged to displace fit-for-purpose GUI and text-based applications. An insurance company might once have depended on a mix of custom-built and commercial systems to support key processes such as enrollment, billing, claim filing, and claim adjustment; by the late-1990s, however, packaged applications were able to replicate many (if not most) of the features and functions these systems provided. <em>But not all of them</em>. More important, some subset of function-specific systems just couldn’t be replaced. The upshot was that even as enterprises restructured their business processes to accommodate packaged suites, they kept some of these processes (and their supporting IT systems) intact, too. The neat thing about RPA is that its software bots run <em>alongside</em> the GUI-based program(s) on the existing system. RPA does not modify the code of an existing system; it doesn’t even require that someone (a developer, engineer, etc.) <em>understand</em> this code. Software bots on one system can also interoperate with software bots on other systems; this permits RPA to knit together disparate systems into a single (managed) process flow.</p>\\n<p>All of this helps account for <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;geo=US&amp;q=robotic%20process%20automation\">keen and trending interest</a> in RPA. In most cases, RPA is a less expensive alternative to conventional practices: to approximate its efficacy (and to account for most possible problems, hiccups, or exceptions) a developer would have to observe what a user like Maddie does over a protracted period of time.</p>\\n<p>RPA also <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-next-acronym-you-need-to-know-about-rpa\">delivers return on investment</a> via increased employee productivity, improvements in process efficiency, built-in auditability, and superior accuracy. (Humans grow bored, get distracted, and don’t notice when they make mistakes. When a software bot makes a “mistake,” it triggers an exception.)</p>\\n<aside data-type=\"sidebar\">\\n<h2>Exception handling</h2>\\n<p>One critical factor for success with any RPA project is exception handling. In practice, the problem of anticipating and controlling for exceptions—i.e., anomalous events—constitutes the most important and challenging aspect of implementing an RPA project. Software robots must learn to identify and control for scenarios that human beings take for granted, such as slow, non-responsive, and frozen applications—or, worse, application errors or crashes. But controlling for application performance, availability, and dependency issues is extremely complicated.</p>\\n<p>One approach is for software robots to poll for resource availability and collect detailed statistics about the host operating system’s state. The robot will use this data to train an ensemble of machine learning (ML) models to identify and handle exceptions. In most cases, however, <em>human beings</em>, not ML models, devise the rules that robots will use to determine what to do when a program is unresponsive or unavailable. How long should the robot wait for a response? Does the robot kill and re-spawn unresponsive programs or processes? These are just a few of the questions a designer must anticipate and control for.</p>\\n<p>The edge cases can quickly multiply, especially in scenarios in which critical programs and operating system libraries are implicated. And that’s the thing: all conceivable exceptions must be accounted for (and built into) the RPA design. An event that might cause a human being to do a double take can bring an RPA process to a complete halt.<br />\\n</aside>\\n<h2>What should be automated?</h2>\\n<p id=\"f1\">RPA automates actions, inputs, behaviors, etc., <em>in the user interface</em>. It is ideal for integration projects that require human manipulation of user interface elements and involve heterogeneous systems. RPA technologies exploit standard<a href=\"#_ftn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> APIs, so integrators won’t have to tinker with existing applications, workflows, processes, or system architecture. In this way, RPA can help reduce the amount of work (along with much of the risk) necessary to integrate heterogeneous applications and systems. This is one of the biggest factors driving the cost-effectiveness of RPA implementations.</p>\\n<p>RPA is not a panacea. Some tasks, even if tedious or repetitive, will require manual human oversight and control. As always, careful analysis of in-process workflows enables you to determine the best overall candidates for robotic automation.</p>\\n<p>In general, the following are good places to start with RPA:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Rote and repetitive tasks</strong>. Pointing-and-clicking a mouse. Copying-and-pasting text.</li>\\n<li><strong>Testing and validation</strong>. Some visual interfaces require substantial time and effort to test prior to deployment. RPA can radically accelerate this process, improve testing, and reduce costs.</li>\\n<li><strong>Redundant tasks</strong>. Basic tasks that multiple users tend to perform in parallel in an organization.</li>\\n<li><strong>Manual tasks with limited variability and few exceptions</strong>. Tasks that are consistent, repeatable, and/or highly predictable are excellent candidates for robotic automation.</li>\\n<li><strong>Human-orchestrated “integrations</strong>.” A user manually copies data from one visual interface and pastes it into another, or a user manually imports the output of one program into another.</li>\\n<li><strong>Any tedious or time-consuming task that looks like it might be a good candidate for automation</strong>. Automating the task should free one or more humans to do more productive work.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The above benefits can lower costs, improve efficiency and quality, and can economically scale, all adding up to significant return on investment for the right RPA projects.</p>\\n<p>The following are probably <em>not</em> good candidates for RPA, however:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>One-off tasks</strong>. A task or process that only needs to run once is not worth an investment in RPA.</li>\\n<li><strong>Unpredictable tasks</strong>. Tasks involving ad hoc or context-sensitive input are not viable for RPA.</li>\\n<li><strong>Turing test-like tasks</strong>. Similarly, tasks that require some kind of visual confirmation—such as, for example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA\">CAPTCHA</a>s—are not always suitable for RPA. This isn’t to preclude <em>all</em> such tasks, however; for example, you could use RPA to automate a process that tests for and validates images of scanned checks. You could even use RPA to test and validate that a CAPTCHA is working. RPA rule of thumb: if it’s repeatable and predictable, it can be automated.</li>\\n<li><strong>Decision-laden processes. </strong>Processes that require human decision making and that involve multiple decision-making stakeholders aren’t usually viable candidates for RPA. If you aren’t comfortable automating some or all of the decisions in a process flow, RPA isn’t a good fit.</li>\\n<li><strong>KISS tasks</strong>. Keep it simple, stupid: if it’s something a human can do quickly, easily, and non-onerously, it doesn’t make sense to automate it. Ditto for tasks/processes that offer low ROI.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>“Doing” RPA</h2>\\n<p>Fundamentally, RPA is an integration and interoperability technology. There is not a one-size-fits-all blueprint for “doing” RPA. There can’t be: every company and every integration or interoperability scenario is different. However, thanks to RPA’s extensive use in the health care, insurance, oil and gas, and government verticals, would-be adopters can avail themselves of resources—e.g., case studies and ROI studies, along with industry-specific consulting and integration services—that will assist them as they plan their RPA implementations. As RPA sees widespread use across <em>all</em> verticals, adopters should expect to encounter complex, unpredictable, and challenging scenarios.</p>\\n<p>Experience with and analysis of the RPA space leads to a formalized list of “Do’s and Don’ts” adopters can use to troubleshoot their RPA implementation projects.</p>\\n<h3>RPA Dos</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>An RPA initiative must have the backing of one or more C-level executives; support from a single line of business (or from IT alone) isn’t sufficient.</li>\\n<li>An RPA initiative must be aligned with the organization’s overall digital transformation strategy.</li>\\n<li>Engaging experts and vendor tools can help speed RPA adoption for those new to the topic.</li>\\n<li>Once a project is up and running, establishing an RPA <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_excellence\">center of excellence</a> can help standardize and disseminate best practices across an organization to foster and speed adoption of RPA where appropriate.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>RPA Don’ts</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Don&#8217;t pursue RPA as a silo-ed, independent, or skunkworks project; align RPA with your organization’s overall vision.</li>\\n<li>Don’t automate a process just for the sake of automating it; RPA gives you a chance to <em>optimize</em> existing processes.</li>\\n<li>Don’t rush into automating a process; plan, test, and validate to achieve success with RPA.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Teams play a very important role in the success of an RPA implementation. Two common RPA-specific job roles are RPA developer and RPA solutions architect; these specialists will augment and liaison with an internal IT team in implementing RPA.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Over the last two to three years, RPA has emerged as a promising technology for workflow and back-office automation. Unlike older automation technologies—such as scripting and screen-scraping—RPA is designed to automate the kinds of tasks that are performed by human users who must interact with and manipulate elements in a graphical user interface. These include custom or proprietary applications that expose basic prompts (buttons, dialog boxes, etc.) or other prompts that expect a user to perform an action of some kind (enter text or number values, left- or right-click a mouse, press a sequence of keys on a keyboard) in response to a visual prompt.</p>\\n<p>The return on investment for RPA projects can be substantial; this alone helps explain the keen interest in the topic. This interest shows no signs of abating. And with Microsoft’s announcement of a new RPA-oriented cloud offering, <a href=\"https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/ui-flows/\">UI Flows</a>, RPA seems poised for mainstream adoption. “Adoption” doesn’t necessarily equal success, however. Like any new technology, RPA’s potential rewards are offset by nontrivial risks. If you understand what RPA can and can’t do, you can make an informed decision about whether RPA is a viable option for you.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<aside data-type=\"sidebar\">\\n<div id=\"_ftn1\">\\n<a href=\"#f1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> GUI/windowing system, kernel/operating system, and, if documented, application APIs.</p>\\n</div>\\n</aside>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/zOKc0HGTTl8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

To most of us, that&#8217;s a complete mystery. Given that we&#8217;re beginning to have a lot of conversations about what we think code should do, and, more crucially, what it shouldn&#8217;t do, I felt I needed to be informed about it to participate in those conversations. I thought, &#8216;Well, actually, so does everyone.&#8217; People aren&#8217;t going to all learn to code, but I could do it on their behalf, so they don&#8217;t have to.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=15\">00:15</a>)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In learning to code, Smith discovered he worked best with Python because he found it very approachable and clear. The biggest challenge, he noted, wasn&#8217;t so much the language itself, but having to learn a new way of thinking. &#8220;What you&#8217;re trying to do is think the way a computer thinks. That&#8217;s the really big hurdle, and that&#8217;s the difficult thing. &#8230; I&#8217;m anthropomorphizing, but trying to get into the mindset of a computer, something that we would do in our analog way very quickly by saying a sentence might take three, four, five, or six steps to communicate to the computer.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=385\">06:25</a>)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Smith has also discovered a cross-over between code and his interest in music. &#8220;Recently when I was in the UK, I got involved with live coding—the program I use is called Sonic Pi, which basically turns your laptop into a musical instrument. &#8230; In the UK, &#8216;algorave&#8217; has become a small underground movement in nightclubs. The performer live codes the music and there&#8217;s a screen behind them that shows the code.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=1084\">18:04</a>)</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/QA6u6y1qQlw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

       "    'value': '<p>In this interview from O&#8217;Reilly Foo Camp 2019, <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-unsupervised-learning/9781492035633/\"><em>Hands-On Unsupervised Learning Using Python</em></a> author Ankur Patel discusses the challenges and opportunities in making machine learning and AI accessible and financially viable for enterprise applications.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Highlights from the interview include:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The biggest hurdle businesses face when implementing machine learning or AI solutions is cleaning and preparing unstructured data that exists across silos. Patel says commoditized infrastructure from companies like Amazon and Google is one of the most significant advancements toward a solution in this area: &#8220;A lot of the work that data scientists would have to do in a custom way is now being done, basically, out of the box by API calls on one of these platforms.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=57\">00:57</a>)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open source is going to provide a &#8220;massive benefit&#8221; for businesses, Patel says. &#8220;In computer vision, for example, starting in 2012, those models were essentially open sourced, so a lot of businesses then got into the business of applying those computer vision models for specific use cases, like autonomous tracking vehicles. So, it&#8217;s going to be less about the models, per se—it&#8217;s going to be more about the use cases and applications of those models.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=117\">01:57</a>)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Open source data and transfer learning are also enabling businesses to more easily move models into production and to achieve an ROI. Patel notes that when data sets are open sourced, &#8220;that means any firm that wants to work on the data set, instead of training their own models, is able to do that. Then you have pre-trained models you can do transfer learning with. If you take a language model, for example, that&#8217;s provided by <a href=\"https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html\">Google&#8217;s BERT</a> and apply it to a corpus of documents that is in your vertical—let&#8217;s say legal documents at a law firm—and you want to make it easier to process law documents as opposed to using paralegals. You can take the massively pre-trained language model, fine tune it on your legal corpus, and then deploy that as a solution. So, you&#8217;re able to see the ROI a lot faster—say in six to 12 months versus what previously would&#8217;ve taken three to five years because you would&#8217;ve had to train your own model from scratch. This idea of transfer learning, using large pre-trained models, fine tuning on your own corpus of text, that is where we&#8217;re going in the near future. I think that&#8217;s something most businesses should be very optimistic about.&#8221; (<a href=\"#t=387\">06:27</a>)</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/huCclkOkAWA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",
