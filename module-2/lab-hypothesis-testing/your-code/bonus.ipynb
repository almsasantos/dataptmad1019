    "# Challenge 1 - T-test\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, t-test is used to test if two data samples have a significant difference between their means. There are two types of t-test:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Student's t-test** (a.k.a. independent or uncorrelated t-test). This type of t-test is to compare the samples of **two independent populations** (e.g. test scores of students in two different classes). `scipy` provides the [`ttest_ind`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html) method to conduct student's t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Paired t-test** (a.k.a. dependent or correlated t-test). This type of t-test is to compare the samples of **the same population** (e.g. scores of different tests of students in the same class). `scipy` provides the [`ttest_re`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_rel.html) method to conduct paired t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of t-tests return a number which is called the **p-value**. If p-value is below 0.05, we can confidently declare the null-hypothesis is rejected and the difference is significant. If p-value is between 0.05 and 0.1, we may also declare the null-hypothesis is rejected but we are not highly confident. If p-value is above 0.1 we do not reject the null-hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read more about the t-test in [this article](https://researchbasics.education.uconn.edu/t-test/) and [this Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-paired-and-unpaired-t-test). Make sure you understand when to use which type of t-test. "
